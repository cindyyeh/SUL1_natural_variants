# SUL1_natural_variants
Scripts used for analyzing natural variant competition of SUL1


mapCCS_reads - aligns PacBio reads to reference sequences. The output files are then ready to be used for barcode-variant mapping. Scripts for doing so can be found here: https://github.com/camorosi/Subassembly_PB_IndelCorrection

merge_count_barseq - counts reads from barcode sequencing, including trimming and pairing scripts. These outputs were used to calculate fitness.
